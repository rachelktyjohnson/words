Using the PRISMA model proposed by Page and Moher (2017), this systematic review found that research into gamification in education were generally aimed at improving academic skills across the formal curriculum (37.50%), but also included increasing motivation and achieving positive results. The results of reviewed research shows that gamification significantly improves =="academic achievement, motivation, task engagement, autonomy, and enjoyment"== (Lorenzo-Lledó et al., p. 871) in 62.50% of studies compared to traditional teaching methods.

The authors used a gamified experience framework, the DMC (Dynamics, mechanics, and components) Pyramid, developed by Werbach and Hunter (2012) to perform their analysis, which states that the foundation of gamification are under three tiered categories: dynamics, mechanics, and components. Their review found that **progression** was the most applied dynamic, **levels** and **challenges** are the most used mechanics, and the **points** component appeared in more than half of the sample.

The review also found additional key insights. Students aged 10-12 years of age are the target age for gamified educational experiences, suggesting that this age group is more suited to gamification. Although the authors sought out literature regarding gamification in the early childhood range, it is clear that their original observation that there is a lack therefore is accurate. Furthermore, the review found that more than half the studies focused on science learning, and that gamified learning experiences are most commonly supported by computer and mobile applications. While both the age range and subject matter associated with gamified learning experiences in this review do not match my own research area of 3-8yo piano learners, the research techniques, relevant reviewed research, and insights from the DMC Pyramid remain valuable. 

One suggested reason for gamification being on the uptick for education to provide an opportunity =="for students to be the active protagonist of their own learning"== (Lorenzo-Lledó et al., p. 870). This resonates strongly with my line of education, where instrumental musical learning is highly personal and where the student is in fact the protagonist of their own learning journey, and so this is an idea that I will be taking with my into my teaching.
